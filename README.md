# Django + React Minimal Fullstack Project

This is a **minimalist full-stack project** designed to help beginners understand how a modern frontend and backend communicate.

The backend is a **Python Django Rest Framework API**, exposing **HTTP-only endpoints**.  
The frontend is a **React application** styled with **TailwindCSS**, using **Axios interceptors** and **Zustand** for state management.

The goal of this project is **clarity over complexity**.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- RESTful HTTP API (no SSR, no templates)

### Frontend
- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Axios (with interceptors)
- Zustand (global state management)

---

## Project Goals

- Be **easy to read and understand**
- Show **clear separation of concerns**
- Demonstrate:
  - API consumption from React
  - Axios interceptor setup
  - Global state handling with Zustand
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or overengineering
